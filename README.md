## Clustering Project for ML

### Project Overview
  - This project explores clustering analysis of various methods and compares their performance on a chosen dataset.
    It's goal is to research/analyse the data through multiple visuals and to understand how clustering methods group.
    This project showcases the proficiency in using Sci-kit Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seasborn, and Matplotlib packages/libraries

### Methods
  - K Means Clustering
  - Heirarchical Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis

###  Dataset
  - The data of renters data in the United States, which included varibales such as coordinates, # of bedrooms & bathrooms,
    square footage, etc.
  - Preprocessing involved normalization, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables

### Results
  - The dataset was designed in two ways, one with encoded variables and one with numerical only features selected. In both K-Means
    and Heirarchical Clustering, having only numerical features performed the best based on their silhouette scores respectively.
    Multiple charts and graphs also support those metrics
